# TheMatrix -- Devito benchmark matrix

Benchmarking Devito solvers across computer architectures, execution models, compilers and anything else we can think of.

The aim of TheMatrix is to:

* Create a platform to enable automated benchmarking across many platforms.
* Perform benchmarking in an open and reproducible manner.
* Make it extendible to new architectures, compilers etc.
* Provide performance baseline for performance optimisation; catch performance regression.

Matrix benchmark parameters include:
* Architecture: Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8168 processor (Azure), Intel Xeon E5 2667 v3 (Azure), NVIDIA Tesla K80 (Azure)
* Execution models: OpenMP, OpenMP offloading, OpenACC, MPI
* Compilers: GCC, LLVM, PGI
* Numerical solvers: isotropic acoustic (3D), TTI (3D)
* Profilers: native performance metrics (runtime, FLOPS, GPt/s), [Air Speed velocity](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

If there is something missing that you would like to see in the matrix then please then let us know...particularly if you can contribute development effort, hardware or funding!

### Performance metrics
See the [Devito FAQ](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/wiki/FAQ) for details on [how Devito computes the performance of an operator](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/wiki/FAQ#how-does-devito-compute-the-performance-of-an-operator).
* GFLOPS - giga floating point operations per second
* FD-GPts/s - finite-difference giga grid points per second 
* Runtime
